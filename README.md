### Description

I need you! Vote for my code, I'm a poor hard-up student in England who can'y afford a pint let alone any fancy software! Thanks!

Need to play a .mid file, look no further here is your solution! This code contains an example of how to use MIDIMod.bas which I have written to play MIDI files. Very easy to use, and sample applcation included with music! Please read the readme.txt file in the xip for further information.
